Crime Record & Investigation Database
Overview
This project implements a crime record and investigation database using ORACLE SQL. It includes tables for officers, cases, suspects, and evidence, along with triggers to log evidence updates and views for common queries.

Database Schema
Officers: Stores officer details.
Cases: Stores case details including status and lead officer.
Suspects: Stores suspect details linked to cases.
Evidence: Stores evidence details linked to cases and officers.
EvidenceUpdatesLog: Logs updates to evidence via triggers.
Files
crime_schema.sql: Contains table creation and indexes.
crime_triggers.sql: Contains trigger and function definitions for logging.
crime_views.sql: Contains views for officer workload and unresolved cases.
crime_sample_data.sql: Contains sample data inserts for testing.
crime_queries.sql: Contains useful queries for data retrieval.
Setup Instructions
Install PostgreSQL if not already installed.
Create a new database for the project.
Run the SQL scripts in the following order:
crime_schema.sql
crime_triggers.sql
crime_views.sql
crime_sample_data.sql
Use crime_queries.sql to run example queries.
Testing
Verify that tables are created successfully.
Verify that sample data is inserted.
Test triggers by updating evidence records and checking the EvidenceUpdatesLog.
Test views by querying OfficerWorkload and UnresolvedCases.
Future Enhancements
Develop a backend API to interact with the database.
Create a frontend interface for easier data management.
Add more detailed audit logging and reporting features.
